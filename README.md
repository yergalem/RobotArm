#Coding Exercise

##Scenario

Genohm is in great distress. We have a client demo coming up, but the Robot equipment we bought to show the 
integration with the Robot Arm (often used by Biobanks) just malfunctioned and a replacement will arrive too late.

One of our best engineers (you!) had the brilliant idea to just mimic the robot arm api as the demo will be done
through a virtual meeting, the physical presence of the robot arm will not matter for the demo.

After some research one of your team members provided you with all the classes currently used by SLims and a 
stub of the RobotArm API. Now it is up to you to implement all the methods and return the correct results so
the demo will be able to be shown smoothly.


Now hurry the demo is coming up soon and the whole team is counting on you!


##How to get started
Import the project into eclipse (you can use any other IDE of your choosing but only for eclipse we will provide)
a step by step instruction:

1. Download eclipse for your current operating system: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
2. Be sure to have the java SDK installed: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html
3. Be sure to have git installed: https://git-scm.com/downloads 
    (on windows be sure to use git-bash, git from eclipse will not work)
